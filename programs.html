            <p>In the spirit of Rotaract’s dedication to service, the initiative, “Honour the Hidden Heroes,” shines a light on those often-overlooked champions who tirelessly contribute to our society from the shadows. For September, our heartfelt gratitude extends to the unsung heroes: Cargo Handlers.</p>
            <p>On the 23rd of September, we had the privilege of donating heating pads to the hardworking cargo workers in Dilshuknagar. Yet, the most priceless part was spending time with them, engaging in conversations that revealed their remarkable stories and witnessing their faces light up with happiness.</p>

            <p>In its first Service Avenue event, the Rotaract Club of GNITS illuminated the spotlight on our unsung heroes – the college Aayas, as part of the 'Honour the Hidden Heroes' initiative. Our club expressed gratitude by gifting eco-friendly jute lunch bags, a small token reflecting appreciation for their unwavering dedication. This simple yet impactful gesture brought genuine smiles to their faces, fostering a sense of connection and respect. Club members shared quality time, listening to their inspiring stories and offering support, further strengthening the bond of care.
                A remarkable day with over 70 beneficiaries at the center of our focus. Together, let's continue making a positive impact!</p>
